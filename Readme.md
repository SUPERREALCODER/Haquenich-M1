## üö≤ Project Description

This repository contains the blueprint for developing a smart electric bike with features like:

- Brushless DC (BLDC) or PMSM motor integration
- Motor control strategies (including regenerative braking)
- Embedded controller interface (Raspberry Pi / Arduino)
- Gear system evaluation (e.g., 30:1 gear ratios for torque optimization)
- Sensor integration for speed, RPM, GPS, and battery monitoring
- Sound emulation to mimic engine noise for pedestrian safety
- Real-time simulation and performance monitoring using Python and MATLAB

This project is open for experimentation with different motor types (e.g., A2212 1000‚ÄØKv or Racerstar BR5108) and includes support for modeling gear reductions and evaluating torque outputs in different terrains.
